Single object tracking (SOT) involves tracking a single object in a video using a bounding box. NanoTrack was implemented to track a single object in a video. 
At the same time, the model underwent a thorough training and testing process on the GOT-10k dataset, a widely used dataset for object tracking that contains 10,000 
video segments with over 560 object classes. The training process was executed on a single GPU (Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080Ti).
